# What is Micro Frontend Architecture?

<div class="bigger">

The concept of <em>micro frontends</em> was first mentioned circa 2016 as an extrapolation of <em>microservices</em> to the frontend realm. Since then it became a goto strategy for splitting a monolithic frontend codebase into smaller pieces that can be owned, worked on and deployed independently.

</div>

---

# What is Module Federation?

<div class="bigger">

Module federation is one of the most popular approaches for implementing micro frontend architecture on either client or server side. With module federation, each micro frontend is treated as a standalone module that can be developed, deployed, and versioned independently, which allows those modules to share and consume each other's functionality, resources, and components, improving collaboration and reusability. Started as a Webpack Plugin, module federation has now evolved into a general concept adopted by other bundlers and frameworks.

</div>

---

# Other Approaches/1

<div class="dense">

-- **runtime Web Components**: each micro frontend is mounted at a custom HTML element, and the container performs instantiation;

-- **runtime Javascript integration**: somewhat similar to both the previous approach and module federation, this one includes each micro frontend onto the page using a `<script>` tag; the container application becomes an entry point, decides which micro frontend to be mounted, and calls the relevant function telling the micro frontend when and where to get rendered; each build file can be deployed independently;

-- **iFrames**: this approach is about rendering various micro frontends in separate iframes and composing those via a container application; the most obvious benefit of this approach is complete decoupling of the application components; however, this approach also has some substantial cons like composition complexity and high potential for performance issues;

</div>

---

# Other Approaches/2

-- **edge-side Composition**: edge-side composition assumes that micro frontends are assembled by the edge using the Edge Side Include (ESI) specification; biggest cons are the fact that support differs depending on the CDN, and each vendor (Akamai, CloudFlare, Fastly, etc.) has its own features and limitations;

-- **dedicated Frameworks for MFE Composition**: one of the easiest ways to implement micro frontend architecture is to use a dedicated framework that takes care of all the ins and outs and lets you focus on the application code; some notable examples of such frameworks are listed below:

<div class="sublist">

  -- client-side: [SingleSPA](https://single-spa.js.org/), [Qiankun](https://qiankun.umijs.org/) (based on SingleSPA), [Luigi](https://luigi-project.io/);

  -- server-side: [Ara](https://ara-framework.github.io/website/), [Bit](https://bit.dev/), [Open Components](https://opencomponents.github.io/), [Piral](https://piral.io/).
</div>

# Glossary

<div class="dense">

-- a **host** is an application that includes the initial chunks of our code, the ones that will be used to bootstrap our container ‚Äì as part of module federation, those are just referenced to a remote, which allows for smaller bundle sizes and shorter initial load times;

-- a **remote** is an module that is being consumed by the host, and it can be both shared components or common dependencies to be used by different hosts;

-- a **bidirectional host** can be either a host or a remote (or both), consuming other applications or providing some code to other hosts.
</div>

# Module federation with Webpack

<div>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, initially module federation was implemented as a plugin introduced in Webpack 5.
To set up Module Federation in Webpack, you need to define the federated modules in your Webpack configuration files, specify the remote entry points and expose specific modules (aka ‚Äúremotes‚Äù) that you want to share with other applications. The remote entry points represent the Webpack builds that expose modules for consumption.</p>

<p>In the consuming application's (aka ‚Äúhost‚Äù) Webpack configuration, you define which federated modules you want to consume. You specify the remote entry points and the modules you want to import from those remotes.
When you build and run your applications, Webpack dynamically loads the federated modules at runtime. It fetches the remote entry points, resolves the requested modules, and injects them into the consuming application. This process allows you to share code between applications without physically bundling everything together.</p>

<p>Note that as an application has multiple dependencies, a host can also have multiple remotes.</p>

</div>

# Getting started

<div class="dense">

#### Requirements

-- Node LTS

-- yarn

#### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nearform/the-micro-frontends-workshop
cd the-micro-frontends-workshop && yarn install
```

</div>

---

# Workshop structure

<div class="dense">

-- this workshop is made of multiple, incremental modules (aka exercises);

-- each module builds on top of the previous one;

-- at each step you are asked to add features and solve problems;

-- you will find the solution to each step in the `src/step-{n}-{name}` folder.

</div>

---

# Running the modules

-- `cd src/step-{n}-{name}`

-- Check out README.md

#### Example

```bash
cd src/step-03-bi-directional

yarn install

yarn run start
```

# Step 1: Setting up the Remote

<div class="dense">

-- there are a few key steps that need to be made in order to expose a module for remote consumption (federation);

-- in this example we are going to demonstrate these steps in a basic React app since any Webpack based application that supports MF will have the similar flow for enabling this feature.

</div>

---

# Step 1: Setting up the Remote /2

<div class="dense">

## Configuring `webpack.config.js` file

In order to enable module federation we need to import `ModuleFederationPlugin` from Webpack on top of this file.

```js
const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container
```

This plugin needs to be instantiated and configured inside the plugins section of the configuration file. The most basic configuration requires `name`, `fileName` and `exposes` key values.

```js
// ....
plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'remoteAppName',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: { './Nav': './src/components/Nav' }
    }),
  ],
```

</div>

---

# Step 1: Setting up the Remote /3

<div class="dense">

-- `name` is where we define a name to distinguish modules. This value will be used by a consumer application when defining remotes inside of it;

-- `filename` can be any value and it will be an entry point for exposed/shared modules. `remoteEntry.js` is most commonly/conventionally used for this purpose;

-- in `exposes` object we define components for remote consumption. Key name should always be in form of `./ComponentName` and the value should be its relative path to Webpack config file.

</div>

---

# Step 1: Setting up the Remote /4

<div class="dense">

## Adding an extra layer of indirection to the entire app

We need `index.js` to be app's entry point but inside of it we need to import another file `bootstrap.js` (named this way by convention) that renders the entire app. This file contains what `index.js` would normally contain in a React app including `ReactDOM.render()` method. To allow Module Federation we need to import it dynamically using `import()` inside of `index.js`.

```js
//src/bootstrap.js
// ... React Code
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

```js
//src/index.js
import('bootstrap.js')
```

Without this extra layer of indirection Webpack would throw the following error when trying to consume the remote module:

```js
Shared module is not available for eager consumption
```

</div>

---

# Step 1: Exercise üíª

<div class="dense">

In `src` folder of the provided basic React application:

-- Create a `Nav` component that takes `links` object as props and displays links as an unordered list in `src/components/Nav.jsx` file.

-- render that element inside `App.js`;

-- render the entire application via `ReactDOM.render()` method inside of `bootstrap.js ` file and import that file in `index.js` file using the `import` statement.

</div>

---

# Step 1: Exercise/2 üíª

<div class="dense">

In `webpack.config.js` file:

-- import `ModuleFederationPlugin` plugin from Webpack's `container` object;

-- in exported modules instantiate `new ModuleFederationPlugin`;

-- pass a configuration object and define values for `name`, `filename` and `exposes` keys. Remember that `filename` uses a naming convention and `exposes` refers to the element that we want to expose.

</div>

---

# Step 1: Solution

```js
// Nav.jsx
import * as React from 'react';
const Nav = ({ links }) => {
  return (
    <nav
      style={{ background: "#872642", width: "100%", color: "white", textAlign: "center", display: "block"
      }}
    >
      <ul>
        { links.map((link, i) => (
          <li key={i} style={{display: "inline-block", padding: "10px 20px" }}>
            <a style={{color: "#F6C026"}} href={link.url}>{link.label}</a>
          </li> )
          )
        }
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
};
export default Nav;
```

---

# Step 1: Solution /2

```js
// src/App.js
import React from 'react'
import Nav from './components/Nav'

const links = [
  { url: '/', label: 'Home' },
  { url: 'https://react.dev/', label: 'Learn more about React.js' },
  { url: 'https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/', label: 'Learn more about Module Federation' }
]

const App = () => (
    <div>
        <h1>Basic Remote Application</h1>
        <Nav links={links}>
    </div>
)
export default App
```

---

# Step 1: Solution /3

```js
// src/bootstrap.js
import App from './App'
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

```js
// src/index.js
import('./bootstrap')
```

---

# Step 1: Solution /3

```js
// webpack.config.js
// .....
const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container
// .....

module.exports = {
    // .....
    plugins: [
        new ModuleFederationPlugin({
            name: 'remote',
            filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
            exposes: {
                './Nav': './src/components/Nav',
            },
        }),
        // .....
    ],
}
```

---

# Step 1: Trying it Out

## From your browser visit :

<div class="dense">

```js
http://localhost:3002

```

And

```js
http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js

```

For the first one you should see a page that displays `Basic Remote Application` title with a `Remote Button`.

For the second one you should see a `script` that exposes our button element for remote consumption.

---

# Step 2: Setting up the Host Application

<div class="dense">

## General Steps:

-- In order to start consuming modules, we need to configure the plugin's `remotes` parameter.

-- This parameter can take an array of different remotes.

```js
// webpack.config.js file
// ...
remotes: {
    remote: 'remote@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js',
},
// ...
```
</div>

---

# Step 2: Setting up the Host Application /2

<div class="dense">

## Next.js specific steps:

-- To enable Module Federation in Next.js we need to import `NextFederationPlugin` in `next.config.js` file since `ModuleFederationPlugin` and `webpack.config.js` are not used in Next.js apps.

-- `filename` property needs to be set using the `static/chunks/{fileName}.js` pattern.

```js
// next.config.js
const { NextFederationPlugin } = require('@module-federation/nextjs-mf');
// ...
config.plugins.push(
    new NextFederationPlugin({
        name: 'host',
        remotes: {
            remote: 'remote@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js',
        },
    filename: 'static/chunks/remoteEntry.js'
    }),
);
// ...
```

</div>

---

# Step 2: Exercise üíª

<div class="dense">

## Create a Next.js app and inside of it:

-- Create `components/nextjs-layout-box.js` file.

-- Place a simple `LayoutBox` component that takes `children` props (e.g. a distinctive background) in that file.

-- Configure the application as the host in `next.config.js` file.

-- Make sure that it also consumes the remote from Step 1 (port `3002`).

-- Render the `LayoutBox` component and display the remote component inside of it.

</div>

---

# Step 2: Solution

```javascript
// next.config.js
const { NextFederationPlugin } = require('@module-federation/nextjs-mf');

module.exports = {
  webpack(config, options) {
    if (!options.isServer) {
      config.plugins.push(
          new NextFederationPlugin({
            name: 'host',
            remotes: {
              remote: 'remote@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js',
            },
            filename: 'static/chunks/remoteEntry.js'
          }),
      );
    }
    return config;
  },
};
```

# Step 2: Solution /2

```js
// components/nextjs-layout-box.js.js
import * as React from 'react';

const LayoutBox = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        background: "cadetblue",
        width: "90%",
        height: "100vh",
        textAlign: "center",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        margin: "auto"
      }}
    >
      { children }

# Step 2: Trying it Out

<div class="dense">

## From your browser visit :

# Step 3: Setting up Bi-Directional Example

<div class="dense">

In this step we are going to demonstrate Module Federation's bi-directional ability to share modules between multiple apps that can act both as the host and the remote at the same time by putting together what we learned in the previous two steps.

---

# Step 3: Exercise

<div class="dense">


-- Set up a `Next.js application` (you can use the same application from step 2) on port `8080`.

-- Create a `LayoutBox` component that takes `children` in `components/nextjs-layout-box.js` file.

# Step 3: Exercise /2

<div class="dense">


-- Set up a `React.js application` (you can use the same application from step 1) on port `8081`.

# Shared dependencies

<div class="dense">

-- **shared dependencies** refer to the libraries, frameworks, or modules that are required by multiple federated modules to function properly. By sharing these dependencies, modules can avoid duplication and ensure consistency and compatibility;

-- shared dependencies typically include runtime libraries, such as **React** or **Angular**, along with any additional utility libraries or common components that are needed by the federated modules. They are typically declared and managed in a shared configuration file, allowing modules to access and utilize them seamlessly.

</div>

Please follow the guidelines from Zack Jackson (inventor & co-creator of module federation):

-- sharing should be done with care - since shared modules cannot be tree-shaken;

-- if you need a singleton (like things that depend on React context), then it must be shared;

-- sharing all dependencies can lead to larger bundles so its best to consider case by case.

---

# Shared dependencies: Shared API

-- **shared (object | [string])**: an object or an array containing a list of dependency names that can be shared across the federated modules;

-- **eager (boolean)**: specifies whether the dependency will be eagerly loaded and provided to other federated modules as soon as the host app starts (otherwise will be loaded lazily when first requested by the federated app);

-- **singleton (boolean)**: whether the dependency will be considered a singleton, which means that only a single instance of it is supposed to be shared across all the federated modules;

-- **requiredVersion (string)**: specifies the required version of the dependency, which makes any incompatible version loaded separately (not shared); note that if the `singleton` property setting `requiredVersion` will raise a warning in case of a conflict.

---

# Shared dependencies: Example

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

const path = require('path');
const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container;
const packageJsonDependencies = require('./package.json').dependencies

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'MyApp',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: { './Button': './src/components/Button' },
      shared: {
        react: { singleton: true, requiredVersion: packageJsonDependencies.react },
        'react-dom': { singleton: true, requiredVersion: packageJsonDependencies['react-dom'] },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

# Step 4: Setting up Shared Modules Example

# Federated Types

<div class="dense">
<p>
When it comes to TypeScript applications, the most common problem with using external libraries (which can be federated remote modules) is that not all of them provide TypeScript types with the original code. In the context of module federation, this problem is aggravated by the fact that Webpack only loads resources from the federated module at runtime, TypeScript, however, needs those during compilation. Long story short, there‚Äôs no obvious way to publish and fetch the compile-time types.</p>
<p>If you are facing this problem, you have following options:</p>

-- referencing types across monorepo (if possible);

-- packaging your types for distribution via a package registry (e.g. npm);

-- @module-federation/typescript,

-- @module-federation/native-federation-typescript.

<p>
Something to keep in mind when using remote types in the host is that as a result the host can become dependent on them. This means that each time remote changes its types, it can potentially break the host.
