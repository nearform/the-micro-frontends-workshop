# Basic One-Way Example

This example demos a basic host Next.js application on port `8080` which imports `Button` component from React.js application on port `3002`.

# Running Demo

Make sure that you have installed all dependencies by running `yarn install` from the **root folder of the workshop**!

From `src/step-03-bi-directional` folder run `yarn install`.

Run `yarn start` from the same folder. This will build and start both React.js and Next.js app on ports `8080` and `8081` respectively.

http://localhost:8080
http://localhost:8081
