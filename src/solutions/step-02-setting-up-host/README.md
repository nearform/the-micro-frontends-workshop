# Basic One-Way Example

This example demos a basic host Next.js application on port `8080` which imports `Button` component from React.js application on port `3002`.

# Running Demo

Make sure that you have installed all dependencies by running `npm install` from the **root folder of the workshop**!

From `src/step-02-setting-up-remote` folder run `npm i && npm start`. This will build and start both React.js and Next.js app on ports `8080` and `8081` respectively.
