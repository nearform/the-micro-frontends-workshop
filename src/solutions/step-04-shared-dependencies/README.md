# Setting up shared dependencies

This example demos a configuration with shared dependencies.

# Running Demo

Make sure that you have installed all dependencies by running `npm install` from the **root folder of the workshop**!

From `step-04-shared-dependencies` folder run `npm install`.

Run `npm start` from the same folder. This will build and start both React.js and Next.js app on ports `8080` and `8081` respectively.
