# Basic One-Way Example

This example demos a bidirectional configuration and module sharing between a React.js and a Next.js app.

# Running Demo

Make sure that you have installed all dependencies by running `yarn install` from the **root folder of the workshop**!

From `src/step-03-bidirectional` folder run `yarn install`.

Run `yarn start` from the same folder. This will build and start both React.js and Next.js app on ports `8080` and `8081` respectively.

http://localhost:8080
http://localhost:8081
